# Mini Game of TicTacToe

I don't code very extensively in #Java, but here learning and applying my previous knowledge. A very very simple TicTacToe Game. Also added an AIPlayer which although isn't exactly AI based but tried to achieve its functionality using Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal move selection.

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/utk145/Java-Mini-Learning-Projects.git

cd Java-Mini-Learning-Projects
cd proj 1 tictactoe

javac *.java
java LaunchGame

```

### Functional Requirements:
- How to place an `X` or `O`
- Multiplayer (player1 and player2)
- How to check for a win
  - Win can happen in terms of rows
  - Win can happen in terms of cols
  - Win can happen diagonally also
